I thought the idea of making Coalton run on Emacs to be fun. This is my "port" of Coalton to Emacs. Unfortunately I cannot continue this effort because of other commitments. I am making this public without any changes.

See init.el and this video for how to run it: https://asciinema.org/a/T2WxxijLz875ZDgDwyjeR4BNv
